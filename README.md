Intended to be JSON parsing for haskell that works and has an API 
that is easy to understand. It is my intention that this works as a single
file that you can chuck into your project, import and BAM - easy json parsing.

## Testing

To run the tests, simply run "runghc Test.hs"

## Jibba jabba

```
cabal update
